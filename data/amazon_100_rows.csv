"1","Thanks for the Feedback","I was all set to purchase Quicken 2004. I received the letter from Intuit stating they were discontinuing support and quote downloads for Q2000. As always, I check Amazon's customer feedback for products before I buy them. I have always been loyal to Intuit and bought their products, but last year's TurboTax put me off, and this just put's me off further. Thanks everyone."
"1","Give it back to Intuit!","I have had nothing but unresolvable problems with the past couple revisions. The other reviewer is right, customer support stinks, Intuit is slow to repond or fix bugs and the product which we are all purchased to centralized our financial information, the very core of our existance, is at best ""dangerous"" to chance using it with your data. Count me as another one to flee to Microsoft Money."
"1","INTUIT You Owe Us All A Refund!!!!!!!","Another consumer who wasted $35 (at Sam's Club) on this horrendous software!Not only does it have all of the aforementioned problems, but its screens are a cluttered mess! What torques me is that I'm unable to rid the screen of things I don't want, need, or use.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!If you have 2000, stick with it. I'm hoping I can reload my 2000 version. 2004 will be donated to some unsuspecting soul via the local Salvation Army thrift shop."
"1","Can't add - hate the GUI","Like many of you I was forced out of Quicken 98 and into 2004. What a lot of useless junk on the screen and ""support"" tells me there's no way to trim down the display. Furthermore the system crashes and can't add during reconciles (!).But here's my question: is there another forum for discussion besides Amazon? A place where we can share usage secrets and compare Quicken with Money or Quickbooks?"
"1","WHAT A RIPOFF - IT'S QUICKEN 2003 WITH A NEW BOX!!","I have been using Quicken for over 10 years and have never been more unhappy with an upgrade than this. I really cannot tell the difference other than the colors.INTUIT - GIVE ME MY $60 BACK!!!"
"3","Solid Audio Rack Stand.","Realizing my DVD, satellite receiver, Tivo, 8-bit Nintendo and archaic VCR were stacking up and cluttering up my interior I purchased this in an attempt to put more order in my life (cables management is step 2 but that's another story). It is solid and heavy and takes a little effort to put together (though nothing as bad as IKEA) but the result is nice and the back has a decent way of putting the cables down the middle and the backs being able to be pulled off with Velcro for easier access. The black is nice but it's still not as modern as I would like it to be."
"4","A Must Read for the Modern Age","I teach an undergraduate class on psychology and the African American experience and have found this book to be a simple but powerful introduction to the reality of the enslavement of Africans. Although intended for a young adult audience, most college students are unaware and untaught this information and thus unprepared to take advantaged of the more critical information provided at that level. This book is an excellent primer.I'll also add that the audiobook is also done well. The voices bring additional weight to the experiences of those enslaved."
"5","THESE GUYS WRITE FANTASTIC SONGS.","I'll say this up front, I know these guys through my brother who does their website and was their soundman for a couple years. These guys will be HUGE someday. Cool guys who know how to write a great song. And they are GREAT musicians. Not like most bands that are popular and can't play for s***! It's unfortunate that things didn't work out with Dan their original Bass Player but I guess things are meant to happen for a reason. So keep your eyes and ears out for these guys. You won't be dissapointed."
"5","Great way to monitor power usage","I bought this to monitor the usage of my HTPC to see if the power supply I was purchasing for it would offer enough power without stressing it. This device functioned superbly. It is an easy one-look way to check the usage of a device. It also can give you an idea how much you might be spending to power something.If you purchase one, walk around your house and plug various things into it (including some of those things with a 'soft-off' state, like a TV). You'll realize how much money in power is literally wasted every minute.Excellent device."
"2","Not user friendly","This is not user friendly at all. The unit is designed so that you cannot have anything else plugged in as it leaves no room for the bottom half of a duplex outlet. Try to test your tv and you need an extension cord for the cable box or any other appliances you may have at an outlet. This was a poor design as all that had to be done was to reverse the locations of the plug and receptacle on the unit.The unit has no memory. When unplugged it loses everything. You have to crawl under desks, behind furniture etc etc to read the numbers. Not very convient at all. Definately would not recommend it."
"3","covers other outlet","The product seems to be working fine but deserves a back eye for halfway covering the 2nd outlet. This is just silly. Maybe the slightly more expensive one doesn't do this?"
"5","Fun!","What a fun product. When I first bought it I ran around plugging everything into it, seeing how many watts each device was drawing. Now that I've had it for a while I will admit that it's been gathering some dust, but it still gets used from time to time. After my most recent power bill at the apartment I think I'll dust it off and give everything a thorough test and see where I can make improvements. A neat gadget, and worth it when you're considering where to improve your energy consumption."
"1","Useless","... and I had such high hopes. According to this thing, none of my appliances use any power at all. I wish.Returning."
"4","Operating instructions","I like the idea of comparing electric usage on different items in my home but I am still trying to figure out what the number readings mean. I'm sure I can put this tool to good use, but there were no practical directions for use. What I got so far is a bunch of number readings but don't know how It has readings for volt, amp, watt, hz, kwh, va, pf, and hour. What in the world is pf (power factor), or, what is the ""hour"" reading, how much time has lapsed since your started the reading, the clock time,or what?. I'm sure I can put this tool to good use, but there were no practical directions for how to use and apply the readings.Ed, MO"
"4","p3 info","A product that does what it states. Fast and easy to use. Opens up the details of how much energy a product consumes. Share it with your friends."
"4","Wish it had a battery","This is a great product that will help you find where you are wasting electricity in your home/office or anywhere you plug stuff in. The only complaint I have with this product is that when I plugged it in to my home entertainment system, I was unable to read the display without unplugging it becuase of the size of my entertainment system.. Ended up using logitech notebook webcam and flash light to see results.. Everywhere else in the house was much easier to get to."
"5","Energy Meter","This is a very neat item. Looking to find your energy leaks?Plug your household products into this and see what kind of enery you are wasting. Some phone chargers actually use energy when left plugged in to the wall and not to the phone. Toasters can also be an energy drain when left plugged in."
"2","Nice product, Bad warranty","This seemed to be a good item, It performed well for few months of use. Then I pluged in a wet vac to check the amp draw and it went blank.I emailed the company about a replacement as it was only 9 months old. they stated the warranty is six months, I could ship it to then and pay $15 and recive a new unit. On the Amazon site it shows one year warranty."
"5","Interesting Tool","I've had my eye on one of these for a while and finally just got one.It does smell strongly of electronics. Doesn't really bother me. I ran it to a max of almost 200W on a computer, haven't had any issues with it so far. It does have a limit of 125V, 15A, 1875VA.As pictures and reviews show, you may want an extension cord or power strip, because it will cover more than one outlet.It measures: Voltage and frequency of outlet. Current, power (W), apparent power (VA), and power factor from the the draw of what is plugged in. Accumulates kWh, shows timer of how long it has been measuring this in minutes and hours.I found that my transformers don't really draw much when not on (<0.1W, display shows 0.0W). A monitor in standby or a suspended laptop can use a few watts, which will add up eventually.The more expensive 4460 or 4480 models have more features but did not seem worth it to me."
"2","Not easy to use.","I wanted this item to compare electrical usage between different appliances. I am not an electrical or mechanical genius, but I thought it would be easier to use than it is. First of all, since it has to be plugged into the wall outlet, it can be difficult to get in place, & then difficult to impossible to read. We made a ""pigtail"" to eliminate this problem, but I still don't always know what the results are telling me. No instructions to speak of doesn't help. It may work for contractors, but not for everyday people"
"4","Useful Too - Idea for upgrade though","Very good tool for assessing appliance energy utilization. You can see current usage real-time. For freezers which cycle on and off, you can measure consumption over a day or week or any length of time.I'd like to see either an illuminated readout or the ability to unplug and have the readings remain visable. It is tough to see usage when in a dark place."
"5","Great Device","If you ever need to find out which one of your electrical devices is a guzzeler, this will do it, and for not too much money. However you will need to add an extension, 3ft or 6ft is fine."
"4","Really a ""watt"" killer","Works as described. With battery back up would get 5 stars. You can plug in and individual component (fridge) or a system of appliances (stereo system) and it will tell you exactly how many killowats used in a given period, allowing you to calculate very accurately how much that unit will cost to run a year. Super idea. Suggest they add a feature that will do the ""year total average"" calculation for you. THAT would be 6 stars!"
"3","KillaWatt monitor","This itemm seems to work as designed. With nothing else to calbrate it, I can't tell how accurate it is. I ussed it to compare two refrigerators, and am satisfied with the results. The only daw back is that it does not store any information after being unplugged, so you generally have to have an extention cord to make it practical."
"5","P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Electricity Usage Monitor","It works as described. I have used it to check power usage on different items in our home and now know how much power is being used by different components. Good to have!"
"2","Not convenient to use","Because of its size and shape, there are very few places this device can be plugged in without displacing other plugs. Thus,to use it in my entertainment center (TV, DVD player etc.) is impossible. To use it for my refrigerator requires unplugging other appliances that share an outlet. The device should have a cord coming out the back. In fact, one could purchase a very short extension cord, connect it to the back of the unit and solve this problem. But why should you have to?"
"1","good, inexpensive meter","This inexpensive watt meter produces amble information about the type and amount of power we use. I have it hooked up to a cellar dehumidifier and hope the power costs will help us decide whether to get a more cost efficient machine. It is very easy to use and read."
"4","Great product","It was sent super fast to me! Works great, although I think it may be a bit inaccurate for very low wattages."
"5","Fun experimenting","My fridge was running ALL THE TIME. We were able to test it. The wattage was not as bad as I expected, but it wasn't really efficient, either. I was very happy to replace it. Be persistent in your tracking so you do a whole week (or some useful measurable amount) of normal usage of what ever it is you want to test. It accepts three prong appliances."
"5","Great Product!","This is a great product. It has helped us determine which items in our house have been using so much electricity and costing us so much money. This product will pay for itself in savings and then will continue saving us money."
"4","Usage monitor can save money","Great device for under $30, except it cost me a lot of money to replace the two energy hogging 25yr old referigerators I had! One suggestion for improvement is a battery backed up memory. As soon as it is unplugged or circuit is interrupted for any reason the data is lost."
"5","Everyone wants to borrow this","This is very handy for finding out your energy waster throughout the house. It can aid in saving you massive dollars on your electric bill. It is accurate and tells you how many amps, volts, and watts are being eaten up. Get on!!! This is also a fair price-just don't tell your neighbors you have one or they will be using it instead of you."
"4","P3 International P4400 Kill A Watt Monitor","This really does work, but the problem is that there is no easy way to put this in a plug if the plug is behind something. Obviously houses have things in them, so that is a little disappointing, but this does work well. I think that it helps in understanding which appliances and electronics are sucking out the most energy, but the problem is if you have a ton of surge protectors, then unplugging and plugging all your things is a hassle. I think there should be a surge protector Kill A Watt which and determine how much energy is being used by each socket."
"3","Cool - but could be improved...","I had to decide between buying this unit and buying the competition - the ""Watts-Up""Watts Up PRO- the pro model of the Watts Up does cost more - but it does more too. My biggest complaint with the ""Kill-A-Watt"" is that the unit covers both outlets in a dual receptical (even if you plug it in the ""top"" outlet as pictured) - so you will want to buy a short pigtail if you need to use this in a duplex or quad outlet. The ""Watts Up"" comes with a cord.Otherwise, it is a fun tool - my kids ran all over the house testing things to see how much power they consumed."
"1","I RECOMMEND THE OTHER VERSION","Make sure you get the other version of this product. This version (the 4400) does not project electricity costs!The ""EZ"" version, theP3 International P4460 Kill A Watt EZ Electricity Usage Monitor, is more useful as it projects your electricity costs."
"3","Try Using Your Hand Instead","I played around with this product but to be honest it is quicker and easier just to use your hand instead. Put your hand on the energy consumer. If you burn your hand this item is a MAJOR energy consumer. 50 watts plus. If it feels warm is is a MINOR energy consumer. Say 15 watts. If you feel no warmth at all -- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT! Objects that consume a reasonable amount of energy at least feel warm. For example, a cell phone charger plugged into the wall with no cell phone attached. Put your hand on it. Does it feel warm? Yes? Then Unplug it! No? Then Don't Worry About It!"
"1","not what you think","DON'T BUY THIS...I read the review and thought this would save me work and some math, I was wrong. This product reads like it will calculate your power usage (hour, day, week, etc.) it doesn't they don't even give you the formulas to figure out the information the ""large LCD"" gives you. SAVE YOUR MONEY, the power usage numbers that come with the product will serve you just as well"
"3","Kill a what?","The Killawatt works OK for 110V appliances but does not work on 220V - i.e. electric dryer, water heater, stove, oven, or other 220v watt eaters. Perhaps another model other than the one I bought works on 220V. Check it out before you buy. Also, there is absolutely no explanation of the various electrical jargon that the device measures. Volts, watts and Kwh are pretty obvious, but the other measures are a mystery. Also no reference to average Kwh usage by typical appliances. This info is on every new energy star appliance, low to high usage, etc. and there should at least be a website link to find this info so one knows if the appliances that they are measuring are watt hogs or perhaps not worth the expense of replacing. Conclusion: not worth the price without 220 V capability and some basic information on what it all means."
"5","P4400 Kill A Watt","I wanted to put a Microsoft MCE computer on line in the living room, but I was afraid of the power usage, We live in Hawaii and pay some of the steepest prices for electricity. Using the P4400 Kill A Watt put my mind at ease. The LCD screen is very easy to read, I had no issues or problems with operating the device. Its nice knowing just how much electricity a device will use, and estimating how much it would cost to run, helps. I'm glad I bought it and would recommend it to anyone."
"5","P4400 Kill A Watt electricity monitor","I bought this unit to measure appliance power consumption to size a solar system. One simply plugs the appliance into the unit and the unit into a 120v power outlet. It will give instantaneous readouts of volts, amps, and watts; and more importantly it will give total watts used over a period of time.It won't save you a dime, it just tells you how much power an appliance uses. It was exactly what I needed at the time, I doubt that I will every use it again."
"2","over priced","Product over priced,the only buttom I uses is the watts per hour. For the average commsumer the other buttoms are useless."
"4","Works Well, but blocks outlets","This is an effective tool for monitoring power usage of applications. It's easy to use with a straightforward interface. My only real complaint with it is that it is hard to plug in without blocking other outlets."
"4","Kill a Watt Monitor","All I can say is that my husband has been having a ball checking out electricity with his new ""toy"". It was worth the money also in showing us where we could save energy."
"2","Takes up both outlets","This is a simple little product really, but it does what its supposed to do. And I would have given it 4 stars based on that...BUT...what idiot designed this thing? It takes up both outlets because of the way they placed the prongs. They are too far toward the middle of the device so it extends over the other outlet. What's with that?And it would have been really nice if they made the plug swivel so it could extend off either end and also work better with surge protectors, etc."
"2","Too difficult to use - covers entire outlet station","Probably would not have returned this if it did not cover both outlets when plugged in. Item is relatively difficult to use and requires some research before being able to determine electrical consumption rates for varying items. Digital output is easy enough to read. Would prefer an item that I can simply enter the cost per watt for my house and have the product display cost per hour, etc."
"4","No Backlit LCD?","I bought this great little gadget to quickly check which devices in my house were using the most power. I was successful, but this product seems to have been designed for long-term energy metering, not quick power checks.First, the LCD panel is not backlit, so if your outlet is in a dark corner, be prepared to get a flashlight and get on eye level to accurately read the display. Second, while it has many different modes for measuring power, I did not see a kilowatt-per-hour reading, which is why I bought it. You can still work out the kWh from the wattage output, but it's more trouble.These strike me as modest upgrades that would have made this device truly excellent. But for the price, this is still the best one out there."
"2","CDI BOX For 1986 Honda TRX 200 SX","I purchesd a cdi box from RICKS MOTOR SPORTS for a honda 1986 TRX 200 SX. When i received the new cdi box it was for a TRX 400 not compatable for with my 1986 trx 200 sx. I left a note in the return package call me or e mail if the wright part available. Have not herd back from anyone i guess part not available."
"4","Crock is an attractive beverage dispenser.","Mine leaked! I replaced the Tomlinson spigot with another unknown brand that I found locally. While the spigots looked identical, the gaskets were different. The Tomlinson had two plastic gaskets and the replacement spigot came with one silicone gasket. The silicone gasket works perfectly.I expected the water from the crock to be cool, but it's no cooler than the water straight from the 5-gal water bottle.I also purchased a Dolphin Pump and it works great right on the 5-gal water bottle. The water from the water bottle is just as cool as the water from the crock. So, forget the crock for water storage and get the pump.However, if you want to serve iced tea, the crock would be very good. The ceramic interior doesn't stain or retain odors.I purchased a white lid for my crock from WaterCrockShop.com."
"1","Life span of this TV is 4 years","I've had this TV for about 4 years and it's broke. I've researched online and other people have the same experience with this TV as me.. about 4 years of use and it breaks.. out of warranty.. so it'll cost a lot to try to fix it..I bet lot of those 5 star rating are people giving those reviews without using for more than few months..What a waste of money. WILL NEVER BUY OR RECOMMEND SHARP TV AGAIN!!!!"
"2","Staying At Home","Dominique says that these songs are close to her heart and about HOME. Dominique dear, as the old saying goes.""You should have stayed at home. Let us hope that your teaching endeavors are much better."
"4","Rock On!","I went to a DKM show and Anti-Flag was opening for them. I was totally blown away! The passion and love these guys play with is incredible. I give massive repect to any band that can open with a d--- good cover of ""White Riot."" Thier CD represents everything good about the first amendment. But however good their CD is, their live show is 10,000 times better. Check 'em out!"
"5","¡Son hijos de putas en la Rosario!","Bersuit Vergarabat `va forzar todo en la concha de su...' por esto letra, y otros mensajes políticos contra el gobierno argentino esta canción era prohibido. Y tal vez por esta razón, cuando yo fui profesor en Gualeguaychu, mis alumnos me dan este CD. Les agradeció mucho.Diez años más tarde, aun estoy disfrutando Bersuit, compre otros discos deles, mas recuerdo Libertinaje. Pienso que es el mejor. Otras canciones excepcionales, `Se viene' `Vuelos', y `¿Qué paso?'"
"4","GREAT FOR THE CAR","I bought this CD player for my mother, who has never owned a CD in her life. She jogs and also has a tape player in her car so i bought the Jogger with the car hook-up. She has not stopped raving about it! She can't believe the improvement in the sound quality. So if you are looking for a good car hook-up and are worried that the sound won't be good, I will vouch that it is at the very least an improvement from a tape player. Her car is a 98 and in good condition so that may help the sound quality. I read a review saying that the sound quality was terrible, but I have to say that was probably an old car with a bad tape player. Also, you can't expect a portable CD player with a car hook-up to sound as good as a regular full sized CD player, especially for $70. For the quality and price i give it 4 stars."
"3","Humble beginnings for this great band...","If my memory serves me correct, this was the band's debut album, and except for the great track ""Electricity"", this album has little else to offer. Many of the tracks are very much in the experimental stage, and overall production was a bit weak. ""Dazzle Ships"" is another very experimental album of theirs, but there the band's experience and artistic flair really comes through well. Although I rate this as their poorest effort, the album is a must for the true OMD fan - even if only to hear the humble beginnings of this great band.If you do not own any OMD music, then perhaps the ""Best Of"" compilation is the place to start. If you already own that, then maybe move to ""The Pacific Age"" or ""Crush"" next, especially if you're a recent OMD fan. Hardcore fans should find this album interesting and worthwhile to own, but keep those expectations down."
"3","Bent fairy tales","If you like fairy tales that turn the genre traditions on their head, this is the book for you. Contains: ""Little Polly Riding Hood"" by Catherine Starr; ""The Gentle Knight"" by Richard Schickel; ""The Faithful Bull"" by Ernest Hemingway (yes, THAT Hemingway); ""The Signal"" by Jack Sendak; ""Princess Dahli"" by Tanith Lee; ""Molly Mullett"" by Patricia Coombs; ""Gudgekin the Thistle Girl"" by John Gardner; ""The Cat-King's Daughter"" by Lloyd Alexander; ""The White Seal Maid"" by Jane Yolen (a bittersweet tale of love and sacrifice); ""The Dark Princess"" by Richard Kennedy; ""Petronella"" by Jay Williams; ""The Wrestling Princess"" by Judy Corbalis (this, along with ""Petronella"", was my favorite. Both had strong female leads and great characterization); ""The Enchanter's Daughter"" by Antonia Barber; ""The Story of the Eldest Princess"" by A.S. Wyatt; and ""The Outspoken Princess"" by Dov Mir."
"5","An Unearthed Jewel","Lisa Ekdahl's fragile voice is the perfect foil for the cool jazz of the Peter Nordahl Trio. The simplicity of the music and song becomes more and more enchanting with each play. Her Scandanavian accent lends just enough uniqueness to these standards to keep them fresh and enjoyable."
"1","Returned for repair unsatisfactory","After little use and only four months after purchase, the power button failed to turn camera off. I returned it for repair and they sent it back saying it was beyond economic repair, due to liquid damage. It was never exposed to any liquid to my knowledge."
"3","Not bad at all, but...","I've had this camera for about a year or so. It was a gift, mainly just to capture those moments in life that you just need to catch.That's what my dad said when he gave it to me anyway.I read all the one star reviews, and I'm happy to say that nothing like what is described in those reviews ever happened to me.I'm not a photography student, but I know if you are seriously into photography this is not the camera for you.Pros; durable, very nice picture quality, nice to look at, many choices of types of shooting to choose from.Cons; horrible battery life (Recommend investing in a lot of rechargeable batteries.) and, this may just be the memory card, but sometimes it takes so long between pictures.Overall, a very nice camera for the average picture taker."
"3","Zoom Disappointment","We have had this camera 18 months and purchased it for the 4x Zoom and 7.1 megapizels. It takes great photos if you have good light and don't use the max zoom. The shutter speed is slow and it won't take photos of moving objects (i.e., my husband and son in a lazy river). Plus the battery life is terrible and rechargable don't last very long.Speed between photos is also slow so I can't capture my little guy doing silly stuff."
"3","Too bulky for a point-and-shoot","I owned this product for 3 years.Pros:-Affordable-Uses AA batteries (very convenient)-Big display screen-Good flash-Good zoomCons:-Drains batteries quickly-Quality of pictures not that sharp for the average joe or experienced photographer-Too bulky for pockets"
"4","GREAT CAMERA","EVERYTHING ABOUT THE CAMERA IS GREAT, EXCEPT THEY ONLY WENT WITH A 2 BATTERY SYSTEM. THAT MAKES THE BATTERIES NOT LAST AS LONG AS A 4 BATTERY ONE. THAT'S THE ONLY THING WRONG. CANNON MAKES A VERY GOOD PRODUCT IN ALL RESPECTS."
"2","camera batteries","I think this is a complicated camera, gonna take some time to learn. I am very surprised at the battery consumption. I have not used it and the batteries are already low."
"3","broke","we had 1 year and had 2 replace or get a re-furbished one. great pics but not durable. liked the size."
"3","Well...","The camera works well and takes great pictures. This is the most important aspect. It was described as being in ""new"" condition, very few scratches. I was disappointed in the condition. It can hardly be described as new. It has dents and scratches. The display has scratches. The most disconcerting thing is the body of the camera feels loose, like it has been dropped at some point. The bottom line is, as long as it works it is worth the price. There were other sellers with the same camera, which might have been better choices."
"2","Canon Powershot A560 Review","I've had this camera for four years and I dislike it very much. The picture quality is atrocious. After a while (depending on how much you use the camera), the camera breaks. The lens cover stopped opening and closing as I powered on and off the camera. Batteries for this camera are a huge expense. Regular batteries only last about 15-20 minutes (also depending on how much you use it) and even if you use lithium batteries they do not last that long. Also the interval between taking pictures is very slow. Another part to thins camera breaking is that half of the settings on mine don't work or broke. The automatic setting breaks quickly and also the camera takes terrible low light pictures, even on the night setting. If you are thinking about getting this camera, I recommend getting a different one."
"3","I hope Canon fixed the lens","My employer provided me with the older A 530 model. It's OK, but the lens has VERY noticeable barrel distortion at the wide end, enough to ruin shots that show buildings or anything else with straight lines (like the ocean horizon). If the 560 has the same lens (and the numbers look the same), then I can't recommend it, even at the price. I hope others will tell me that the newer models have fixed this problem."
"5","AMAZING!","I have an aunt that is a hair stylist, she gave me a perm because I wanted one, But I wanted spiral curls. But due to all the previous damage to my hair from it going from dark brown to blonde and such it was a mess and it was very poofy. So I had a friend who told me about this product. Before I had the perm I could just get right out of the shower let my hair dry and it was perfectly straight! Now after the perm and then this treatment its back to normal! I can't begin to tell you how happy I am to have my hair back to normal!!"
"1","Sport Diver II Camera","I used this camera once and have no good photos to show for it. It took 5 frames then skipped several and took 2 more, then nothing for the rest of the roll. We swam with sharks and I have nothing to show for it. Should have bought a disposable one."
"3","Nice sock but would not consider plus size","Good quality sock, but not really plus size in the ankle/leg area. Did not seem stretchy enough. I will have to pass them on to my boys who wear 8 men's size."
"1","piece of junk","a while ago my cd player broke, i decided to let it r.i.p. and take my mom's, cos she never uses it. the minute i started listening to it i was disgusted. by what you ask? the same problems as everyone else:*it's flimsy and breaks very easily, and i'm one of those people who uses the special spot on their backpack for cd players.*it skips like a mofo.*THE WHITE NOISE!!!!!*AAA batteries are annoying.*volume doesn't go up that loud.*the ""surround mode"" [...stinks] so bad and makes good music sound [...bad].*the headphones are junk.there is one good thing about it:*it's slim and tiny, but it still has a nice big LCD."
"2","Not pleased","These wireless headphones were easy to install and use but have too much static and are easily blocked so if you even try to adjust them on your ears, you can lose reception for a few seconds. I also don't like the behind the head construction. I wouldn't buy them again. I have a pair of wireless headphones I can use with my PC that work much better, with much nicer sound quality and range."
"4","Nice, cheap wireless headphones.","I purchased these headphones as a cheap solution for hearing the tv while using a loud treadmill fan. The headphones work well.The headphones do not exactly fit my big head but it's good enough. I wear them as much as 45 minutes at a time without issue. Note that these are infra red headphones so you need a clear line of sight between the headphones and the transmitter. At least when u do lose the signal, you dont get the loud static noise in your ear."
"3","Lower Your Expectations...","It's a paradox: even though one good idea or piece of wisdom can expand life infinitely,because of the expense of this program, people considering buying it should be aware that it may be much shorter than they expected (some tapes only run 25 minutes a side), that the speakers even repeat the same anecdotes, and that much of the material is quoted from other sources (particularly poets). The program includes some GEMS, particularly from Deepak Chopra.(I found the tone of the Dyer contributions condescending.) Still, for a person truly looking for ""what it's all about"" (on a limited budget!), I would recommend the ""Living, Healing & Being"" audio series by Mitchell May or ""Creating Your Heart's Desire"" by Sonia Choquette. In closing I would like to say that the speakers' good intentions in creating their program are tangible and thus I hesitated to write this, but for the price, I feel the buyer deserves more."
"5","Simply Love is Simply Class","The purity of Kay's voice is breathtaking! She really knows how to manifest in her songs the heart and soul of a beautiful person. The exquisitely lyrical music, and of course the lyrics themselves, shows an artist of depth beyond her years. She has a great voice that can really touch your heart."
"4","One of the best family films I've seen.","This is a touching, funny film. Definitely for the whole family. Two bumbling ex-con's are suspected of kidnapping a little girl, when in reality she had runaway from home because her parents were to busy to pay attention to her. The ex-cons want to return her but they don't think anyone will believe their side of the story and the little girl is in no hurry to return to her parents. I've looking to buy this film since I first saw it in 1982."
"3","Not the best quality but okay for the price I paid.","The quality of the movie was less then par. It looked like someone took the original vhs and just copied it onto a dvd. I can't really complain though. The price I paid gave me the quality I deserved, I guess.... So to sum it up. Great price for vhs quality movie."
"4","I loved this movie...","I loved this movie when I was five. I even insisted that we name my little sister Savannah. I can't say that I'd stand in line to see this movie again, but if you have a five year old, it's sure to be a hit."
"5","Why?","I am just wondering why Savannah Smiles is not being made? I think it is a must see classic! There are a lot of no name movies out there you can buy, so is this just a way make people suffer?"
"4","old but very cute","This movie I was when i was a little girl and I have been looking for it and I finally found it. This is one of the sweetest cutest movies ever. I always forget that every single time it makes me cry but other than that it is a really great movie. I hope all of you enjoy!"
"5","Funny and sweet movie!","Over the years I have watched this movie several times. It is somewhat dated, but still worth a watch. Try it."
"5","savannah smiles","Savannah Smiles was the very first movie I saw when I got cable 25 yrs ago. My husband, myself and my 3 children thoroughly enjoyed the movie then and were even more happier to see it again now. And we sat there and watched it two more times that day, that's how much we loved it."
"3","Count on 2 weeks shipping","The product came as advertised but took almost 2 weeks to come in the mail."
"5","Beloved movie from childhood","I loved this movie as a child and loved when I watched it again as an adult. I wouldn't recommend it for small children to watch though, but older children and adults should watch this movie at some point in their lives. You gotta love Savannah. It makes you think about how much your kids know and how much they pick up on from parents and how naive they can be at the same time. Great movie. Maybe I'll watch it again tonight!"
"3","Informative but a difficult to decipher","I found this book difficult to digest. The language used throughout appears to be some form of official medical speak; so much so that - as an example - in one section, I could not determine whether the author advocated drinking cranberry juice or not (until the last sentence of that sections which seemed to suggest that it is a benefit). That being said, I found the information useful although not very clearly presented. I look forward to a revised edition in which the editor(s) revises the language so that it is comprehensible to those without a medical or nutrition background."
"5","Must read if you like history or people!!","I found this book a few years ago and read it cover to cover! Let us say that history is stranger than fiction. You will also learn that some of the scandals we have now have been done way before in American history. A great example is the voting debacle in Florida with George Bush. That was not the first time it has happened in American history regarding a presidential election miscount!! I am on this page now because I gave away this book years ago and REGRET it!I was watching a documentary on Sacco and Vanzetti and realized I had read about it in this book years ago!!MUST READ!!!"
"4","my thoughts","i really enjoyed this movie and thought it was fantastic, the acting as well as the presentation. for a change it lived up to my expectations. thanks."
"3","gran torino","This movie missed a golden opportunity to educate the american people of the great sacrifice of the Hmong people and the ongoing genocide of these people for their fierce fighting along side of our troops in Viet Nam."
"1","SAD RACIAL STEREO TYPES BONUS POOR ACTING","All I can say is my Love for Clint has been tested.Words like ""cracker"" ""hunky"". Did Archie Bunker write this?The slang was dated, obviously from his Dirty Harry days.Clint lines were the only ones delivered with meaning.The other ""actors"" sounded like they were rehearsing for a school play.The fondation was set, but nothing but nonsense was built upon it.The over zealous Father from the church was laughable.The Mhoung gang was funny as well.We found ourselves laughing at inappropriate times.PRO: NOT AS AWFUL AS SPIKE LEE'S MIRACLE AT ST ANNA."
"1","Horrible!!!!","To this day I still do not understand the praise this movie gets! I get what the movie is trying to do. I get the whole racism, old man in a new world, coming to terms with yourself...blah blah blah. Those things are all well and good if they are done in a halfway decent fashion. First off the acting is on par with any Soap Opera on TV. I could barley sit the through the thing because of this. I think I actually felt vomit touch the back of my throat trying to watch this movie. Second the whole story is just corny as hell. This is pretty much it ""Grumpy - Racist old man hates the world...takes sissy Asian kid under his wings...finds peace "". The last thing that really made me want to slit my own throat was the scene where Clint is so shocked that he drops his shot glass. It was so over dramatized....I can't even stand to talk about movie.Do you self a favor and skip this Over Hyped piece of garbage!"
"3","Eastwood works.","Haven't had time to watch it, but like Eastwood movies and heard it had good reviews."
"5","Great movie to own.","If you like Clint Eastwood you will enjoy having this movie in your collection. I recommend this movie to all audiences."
"5","Clint Eastwood fans should buy this movie!","This movie is a must have for Clint Eastwood fans. You will laugh, cry and go through a wide range of emotions from watching this film."
"4","I'm no hero.","Indeed, Walt Kowalski says he's no hero, and he isn't. Except that he is an old man deeply troubled enough by his acts in the Korean War to stand up for those unjustly persecuted. The story is compelling, but considering Eastwood's brilliance and success behind other films the star quality just did not convey in this one. Kowalski was well-acted, though it was Ahney Her as Sue who shone. She was the only one who seemed to be in the part and not just acting it. The flow of the film was a bit slow and its transitions quite choppy. The editing just did not seem to be on par, which resulted in some of characterization of Kowalski seeming contrived if not completely off. Despite its patchy qualities this film delivers a powerful story, that while potentially predictable does not detract from its power."
"3","Grand Torino DVD (Full Screen Edition)","All I Can Say Is, So I Don't Give Away What The Movie is About Is That I Did Not Like The Ending."
"2","How the Clint Stole Christmas","Seriously, can you believe this insipid film? At best, it's a good episode of ""CHiPS"" -- at worst, a bad episode of ""CHiPS"". And what horrid acting, all around! Hard to actually see Clint's heart growing bigger, but you know it did. Well, you assume as much. Don't you?"
"5","Amazing Film","I saw a review earlier that mentioned the movie ""Crash,"" which was a terribly overrated film. ""Crash"" does not compare to the brilliance of Clint Eastwood's ""Gran Torino."" This movie teaches a wonderful lesson and does so beautifully.Being Eastwood's last starring role in a film, he did a magnificent job at creating a believable character.I could go into more details about the film, but this is one that everyone should see for themselves. Words will not do it justice."
"1","not that into it","I'm not crazy about this movie. I think the best part of the whole movie is the ending. When Walt leave's his house to the church. Instead of his son's family. They don't deserve that house after the way they were to him. I'm also happy that he gave his car to that chines kid instead of his granddaughter. She also doesn't deserve anything,"
"3","Gran Torino","Loved the movie but the closed captioning did not work so I tough it out when I watch this film. This is the second DVD that was sent out because the first one would not load or play and I kept getting the message of error on disc."
"3","One of Eastwoods best...","Movie is GREAT! Have watched it several times and it clearly is a masterpiece. I am only giving this item 3 stars though due to the lack of special features on the disk, It is presented like a poor quality dvd with no special features, menu sucks, cheap case and insert, etc. A shame really that they would treat a movie that way..."
"2","Missed opportunity to be a great film- Instead of a cliche","I enjoyed most of this film. However, I agree with others that the film relies on contrivances and an unoriginal storyline. It seems that the writer felt that the film had two possible ways to go: One way could be the ""Dirty Harry"" route where Eastwood brilliantly gets violent revenge on the bad guys...Or, the other possible ending could be melodramatic with much hanky-wringing and a ""message"". Neither option is appealing given the age and health of the main character...and the values he was trying to teach the young man. There was a huge missed opportunity to tell a different story based on the certain realities that each of the characters must accept. This could have been a great film...Instead it's just more of the same."
